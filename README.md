# Tracking Nationalism Around the World

## Project Motives and Ideas

This project aims to dive deeper into extracting the data in the [GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) which is a 'global database of society'.  More specifically, I aim to investigate nationalistic movements around the world through NLP practices as well as investigating trends over time using time series analysis.  

> *Nationalism*:  
> [Nationalism is an idea and movement that promotes the interests of a particular nation (as in a group of people) especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the nation's sovereignty (self-governance) over its homeland.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_(disambiguation))

## Challenges 

What will be challenging is determining what constitutes as nationalistic media since, most nationalists don't tend to use the word 'nationalism' when referring to themselves or their movement.  So I will need to investigate ways to categorise articles as nationalistic.  To do this, I might first start with training models on articles that are known to be nationalistic to determine patterns.  The hard part will be extracting these pieces from the database.
